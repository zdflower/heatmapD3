Free Code Camp Project instructions: https://learn.freecodecamp.org/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-heat-map

- [x] #1: My heat map should have a title with a corresponding id="title".
- [x] #2: My heat map should have a description with a corresponding id="description".
- [x] #3: My heat map should have an x-axis with a corresponding id="x-axis".
- [x] #4: My heat map should have a y-axis with a corresponding id="y-axis".
- [x] #5: My heat map should have rect elements with a class="cell" that represent the data.
- [x] #6: There should be at least 4 different fill colors used for the cells.
- [x] #7: Each cell will have the properties data-month, data-year, data-temp containing their corresponding month, year, and temperature values.
- [x] #8: The data-month, data-year of each cell should be within the range of the data.
- [x] #9: My heat map should have cells that align with the corresponding month on the y-axis.
- [x] #10: My heat map should have cells that align with the corresponding year on the x-axis.
- [x] #11: My heat map should have multiple tick labels on the y-axis with the full month name.
- [x] #12: My heat map should have multiple tick labels on the x-axis with the years between 1754 and 2015.
- [x] #13: My heat map should have a legend with a corresponding id="legend".
- [x] #14: My legend should contain rect elements.
- [x] #15: The rect elements in the legend should use at least 4 different fill colors.
- [x] #16: I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding id="tooltip" which displays more information about the area.
- [x] #17: My tooltip should have a data-year property that corresponds to the data-year of the active area.
